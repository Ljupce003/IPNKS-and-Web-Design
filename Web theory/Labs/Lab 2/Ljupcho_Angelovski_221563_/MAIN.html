<p><b>HTML</b> (HyperText Markup Language) is the most dominant <a href="Markup.html">markup language</a> which is used for making web pages. This language is<br>
    used to describe the structure of information in a text-oriented documents with the labeling / marking / highlighting certain parts of the text<br> such
    as <u>headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.</u>where the marked text is replaced with interactive forms, embedded images or other objects.<br>
    HTML also describe, to some degree, the appearance and semantics of the document and may contain additional features, such as<br>
    embedded programming code that can influence the behavior of a web browser or any other HTML processors. In HTML 4 <del>there is no</del><br>
    clear definition of the content from the rest of the page.

                  Almost all markings must be completed.
                  Most commonly ended adding &lt/****>
                  &ltstrong> (the marking you want to end is written in place of the asterixs) &lt/strong>
           &lt/body>
